# Subscription Status Caching Implementation

## Overview

Implemented module-level caching for user subscription status in the User Profile Modal. The subscription status is now fetched once on startup and cached until the page is reloaded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `useSubscription` Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useSubscription.ts`)

#### Module-Level Cache Variables

Added three module-level variables that persist across component re-mounts but are cleared on page reload:

```typescript
let subscriptionCache: SubscriptionStatus | null = null;
let subscriptionCacheUserId: string | null = null;
let isFetchingSubscription = false;
```

#### Key Features

1. **Single Fetch on Startup**

   - Subscription status is fetched only once when the user is authenticated
   - Subsequent calls to `useSubscription()` use the cached data
   - No additional API calls when opening/closing the User Profile Modal

2. **Cache Persistence**

   - Cache persists across component re-mounts
   - Multiple components can share the same cached data
   - Cache is automatically cleared on page reload (new browser session)

3. **User-Specific Caching**

   - Cache is tied to the user ID
   - If user changes (logout/login with different user), cache is invalidated
   - Prevents showing wrong subscription status for different users

4. **Prevent Duplicate Fetches**

   - Added `isFetchingSubscription` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous API calls
   - Ensures only one fetch happens even if multiple components mount at once

5. **Manual Cache Invalidation**
   - `refetch()` function now clears cache before fetching
   - Useful when subscription status changes (e.g., after payment)

#### Updated Functions

**`useSubscription()`**

- Initializes state with cached data if available
- Checks cache before making API calls
- Stores fetched data in both component state and module-level cache
- Clears cache on logout

**`useInvalidateSubscriptionCache()`**

- Now clears both backend cache AND frontend module-level cache
- Ensures complete cache invalidation when needed

**New: `clearSubscriptionCache()`**

- Utility function to manually clear the frontend cache
- Useful for testing or debugging

## How It Works

### First Time (No Cache)

1. User logs in and app loads
2. `useSubscription()` is called (e.g., by UserProfileModal)
3. No cache exists, so API call is made to `/api/subscription/status`
4. Response is stored in:
   - Component state (`subscriptionData`)
   - Module-level cache (`subscriptionCache`)
   - User ID is stored (`subscriptionCacheUserId`)

### Subsequent Opens (Cache Available)

1. User closes and reopens UserProfileModal
2. `useSubscription()` is called again
3. Cache is found for the current user
4. Cached data is used immediately, no API call
5. Component displays subscription status instantly

### Page Reload

1. User reloads the page (F5 or browser refresh)
2. Module-level cache variables are reset to `null`
3. Next `useSubscription()` call will fetch fresh data
4. Fresh data is cached again

### User Logout

1. User logs out
2. `useSubscription()` detects `!isAuthenticated`
3. Module-level cache is cleared
4. Component state is cleared

## Benefits

1. **Performance**

   - Reduces unnecessary API calls
   - Instant display of subscription status
   - No loading state on subsequent modal opens

2. **User Experience**

   - Faster modal opening
   - No flickering or loading states
   - Consistent subscription status display

3. **Resource Efficiency**

   - Less server load from repeated API calls
   - Reduced network traffic
   - Better battery life on mobile devices

4. **Reliability**
   - Single source of truth during session
   - Consistent data across components
   - Prevents race conditions

## Testing

### Test Cache Functionality

1. Open the app and log in
2. Open User Profile Modal â†’ should see API call in console
3. Close and reopen modal â†’ should see "Using cached subscription status" in console
4. Reload page (F5) â†’ should see new API call on next modal open

### Test Cache Invalidation

1. Call `refetch()` from the hook â†’ clears cache and fetches fresh data
2. Use `useInvalidateSubscriptionCache()` â†’ clears both frontend and backend cache
3. Logout â†’ cache is automatically cleared
4. Login with different user â†’ new cache is created for new user

### Console Logs

- `ðŸ”’ Subscription Status (fetched and cached):` - Fresh data fetched and cached
- `ðŸ”’ Using cached subscription status for user:` - Cache hit, using existing data
- `ðŸ”’ Using cached subscription on mount` - Component mounted with cached data
- `ðŸ”’ Subscription fetch already in progress, skipping...` - Prevented duplicate fetch

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- âœ… No breaking changes
- âœ… All existing components work without modification
- âœ… API interface remains the same
- âœ… Error handling unchanged

### Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- Cache expiration time (e.g., 5 minutes)
- Background refresh on stale data
- LocalStorage persistence for longer-term caching
- Cache warming on app initialization

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/hooks/useSubscription.ts` - Added module-level caching

## Files Using This Hook

- `frontend/src/components/garden/UserProfileModal.tsx` - Primary consumer
- Any other components using `useSubscription()` will benefit from caching

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/subscription/status` - Fetch subscription status (cached on frontend)
- `DELETE /api/subscription/cache` - Invalidate backend cache (now also clears frontend cache)
