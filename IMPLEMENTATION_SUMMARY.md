# Available Inventory Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
- **Issue**: StructuresModal showed total inventory count, not accounting for structures already placed in level config
- **Solution**: Implemented smart calculation that shows only **available (unused) structures**

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes

#### 1. New Data Structure
**File**: `/frontend/src/store/selectors/worldSelectors.ts`
```typescript
export interface AvailableStructureItem {
  structure_name: string;
  count: number;           // Total owned
  available_count: number; // Available to place
  placed_count: number;    // Currently placed
}
```

#### 2. Smart Selector Implementation
**Function**: `selectAvailableStructureCounts`
- Counts placed structures from level config (`currentPlots`)
- Maps structure IDs to names using `structureConfigs`
- Calculates: `available = total_owned - currently_placed`
- Returns enhanced inventory data with usage breakdown

#### 3. Updated StructuresModal UI
**File**: `/frontend/src/components/garden/ui/StructuresModal.tsx`
- Uses `selectAvailableStructureCounts` instead of raw inventory
- Shows only structures with `available_count > 0`
- Enhanced info panel displays:
  - Available structures (can be placed)
  - Total owned structures
  - Currently placed structures

### ðŸ”„ Data Flow Example

**Before**:
```
Inventory: [{ structure_name: "Mailbox", count: 3 }]
Display: "Mailbox (3)" // Shows all 3, even if 2 are placed
```

**After**:
```
Level Config: ["mailbox", "mailbox", "empty", ...]
Inventory: [{ structure_name: "Mailbox", count: 3 }]
Calculation: available = 3 - 2 = 1
Display: "Mailbox (1)" // Shows only available for placement
```

### ðŸ“Š Benefits

1. **Accurate Display**: Users only see structures they can actually place
2. **Better UX**: No confusion about available vs in-use structures  
3. **Real-time Updates**: Automatically reflects placements/removals
4. **No Backend Changes**: Uses existing APIs and data structures
5. **Comprehensive Info**: Shows usage breakdown in info panel

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

- Created test file: `/frontend/src/tests/availableInventoryTests.js`
- Comprehensive documentation: `/AVAILABLE_INVENTORY_FEATURE.md`
- No compilation errors
- Maintains backward compatibility

### ðŸš€ Ready for Use

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Users will now see:
- Only placeable structures in the inventory modal
- Clear breakdown of owned vs available vs placed counts
- Accurate inventory management without backend changes

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

1. Visual indicators showing where structures are placed
2. Drag & drop for moving structures between plots
3. Bulk structure management operations
4. Usage analytics and recommendations
