# Profile Picture Display Fix - Implementation

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🐛 Problem Summary

**Issue:** After uploading a new profile picture, the EditProfileModal continued to display the old image instead of the newly uploaded one.

**Root Cause:** Field name mismatch between backend API response (`user_picture_url` - snake_case) and Redux state (`userPictureUrl` - camelCase). The ProfilePicture component was reading from the initial User prop instead of the updated Redux state.

---

## ✅ Fix Implemented

### File 1: `frontend/src/components/garden/ui/EditProfileModal.tsx`

#### Change 1: Add Redux User Selector

```tsx
export default function EditProfileModal({
  isVisible,
  onClose,
  user,
  onUserUpdated,
}: EditProfileModalProps) {
  // Redux hooks
  const dispatch = useDispatch<AppDispatch>();

  // Get fresh user data from Redux (for updated profile picture URL)
  const reduxUser = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth.user); // ← NEW

  // State management
  // ...
}
```

**Why:** This gives us access to the Redux state which gets updated immediately after upload.

#### Change 2: Use Redux State in ProfilePicture Component

```tsx
<ProfilePicture
  size="120px"
  userId={userId}
  imageId={reduxUser?.userPictureUrl || (user as any).user_picture_url} // ← FIXED
/>
```

**Before:** `imageId={(user as any).user_picture_url}`  
**After:** `imageId={reduxUser?.userPictureUrl || (user as any).user_picture_url}`

**Why:**

- Prioritizes Redux state (`userPictureUrl`) which gets updated immediately
- Falls back to User prop (`user_picture_url`) for initial render
- Ensures newly uploaded image displays immediately

### File 2: `frontend/src/components/garden/UserProfileModal.tsx`

#### Change 1: Add Redux User Selector

```tsx
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { RootState } from "@/store";

export default function UserProfile({ isVisible, onClose, user }: UserProfileProps) {
  // ...existing hooks...

  // Get fresh user data from Redux (for updated profile picture URL)
  const reduxUser = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth.user); // ← NEW

  // ...
}
```

#### Change 2: Use Redux State in ProfilePicture Component

```tsx
<ProfilePicture
  size="100px"
  userId={user.id || user.userId}
  imageId={reduxUser?.userPictureUrl || (user as any).user_picture_url} // ← FIXED
/>
```

**Before:** `imageId={(user as any).user_picture_url}`  
**After:** `imageId={reduxUser?.userPictureUrl || (user as any).user_picture_url}`

**Why:** Same fix as EditProfileModal - ensures profile picture updates are visible immediately after upload.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Upload Flow (FIXED)

```
1. User uploads image
   └─> Backend stores in MinIO (study-garden-bucket)
   └─> Returns { image_id: "new-uuid" }

2. Update user profile in ArangoDB
   └─> Backend updates user.user_picture_url = "new-uuid"
   └─> Returns { user: { user_picture_url: "new-uuid" } }

3. Update Redux state
   └─> dispatch(updateProfilePicture("new-uuid"))
   └─> state.auth.user.userPictureUrl = "new-uuid"  ✅

4. ProfilePicture component re-renders
   └─> Reads reduxUser.userPictureUrl = "new-uuid"  ✅
   └─> Fetches new presigned URL from backend
   └─> Displays new image immediately  ✅
```

## 🎯 What Changed

### Data Flow Comparison

**BEFORE (Broken):**

```tsx
<ProfilePicture imageId={user.user_picture_url} />
                          ↑
                User prop (not updated after upload)
                Shows OLD image ❌
```

**AFTER (Fixed):**

```tsx
<ProfilePicture imageId={reduxUser?.userPictureUrl} />
                          ↑
                Redux state (updated immediately)
                Shows NEW image ✅
```

## 📊 Field Name Reference

For future development, here's the field mapping:

| Context               | Field Name         | Type       |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **Backend API**       | `user_picture_url` | snake_case |
| **ArangoDB**          | `user_picture_url` | snake_case |
| **Redux UserSession** | `userPictureUrl`   | camelCase  |
| **Common User Type**  | `user_picture_url` | snake_case |
| **Image API**         | `image_id`, `url`  | snake_case |

**Best Practice:** When passing to ProfilePicture component, always use Redux state for current user to ensure fresh data.

## 🔍 Related Components

### Components That Display Profile Pictures

1. **EditProfileModal** ✅ FIXED
   - Uses: `reduxUser.userPictureUrl`
   - Status: Updated to read from Redux
2. **UserProfileModal** ✅ FIXED
   - Uses: `reduxUser.userPictureUrl`
   - Status: Updated to read from Redux
3. **GardenIcons** ✅ OK

   - Location: `frontend/src/components/garden/GardenIcons.tsx`
   - Already uses: `user_picture_url: reduxUser?.userPictureUrl || null`

4. **CachedProfilePicture** ✅ OK
   - Uses userId to fetch, doesn't rely on prop

---

## 🚀 Additional Improvements

### Optional: Cache Invalidation

Add explicit cache invalidation after upload for better reliability:

```tsx
// After successful upload
if (updateResponse.success) {
  // Update Redux
  dispatch(updateProfilePicture(updateResponse.user.user_picture_url));

  // Invalidate profile pictures cache
  dispatch(invalidateProfilePicture(userId)); // ← NEW

  // Reload image info
  await loadUserImageInfo();
}
```

### Optional: Standardize Field Names

Consider converting all backend responses to camelCase at the API boundary:

```typescript
// Create a transformer utility
const transformUserFromAPI = (apiUser: any) => ({
  userId: apiUser.user_id,
  userEmail: apiUser.user_email,
  userName: apiUser.user_name,
  userPictureUrl: apiUser.user_picture_url,
  // ...
});
```

## 📝 Code Comments Added

Added explanatory comment in EditProfileModal:

```tsx
{
  /* 
  Use reduxUser.userPictureUrl (camelCase) for updated image_id
  Falls back to user.user_picture_url (snake_case) from props
  This ensures we show the newly uploaded image immediately
*/
}
```
