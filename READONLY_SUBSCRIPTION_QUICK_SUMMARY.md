# Read-Only Subscription Hook - Quick Summary

## What Changed

Created a **read-only** version of the subscription hook that prevents the User Profile Modal from triggering any subscription updates or fetches when it opens.

## The Problem

Opening the User Profile Modal was running subscription logic (useEffect) even though the data was already cached. This was unnecessary and could cause unwanted side effects.

## The Solution

### New Hook: `useReduxSubscriptionReadOnly()`

A stripped-down version that:

- ❌ No automatic fetching
- ❌ No useEffect hooks
- ✅ Only reads from Redux store
- ✅ Still provides refetch/invalidate if needed

### Updated UserProfileModal

```typescript
// Before
import { useReduxSubscription } from "@/store/hooks/useReduxSubscription";
const { isPaid: hasSubscription } = useReduxSubscription();

// After
import { useReduxSubscriptionReadOnly } from "@/store/hooks/useReduxSubscription";
const { isPaid: hasSubscription } = useReduxSubscriptionReadOnly();
```

## Behavior Now

1. **GardenIcons loads** → Fetches subscription (once)
2. **Open modal** → Reads cached data (no fetch, no logs)
3. **Close modal** → Nothing happens
4. **Reopen modal** → Reads cached data (no fetch, no logs)

## Benefits

✅ Modal doesn't trigger subscription logic  
✅ No console logs when modal opens  
✅ Cleaner separation of concerns  
✅ Better performance (no useEffect overhead)  
✅ More predictable behavior

## When to Use Each

| Hook                             | Use When                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `useReduxSubscription()`         | Component fetches data (GardenIcons)       |
| `useReduxSubscriptionReadOnly()` | Component displays data (UserProfileModal) |

## Files Changed

1. `frontend/src/store/hooks/useReduxSubscription.ts` - Added read-only hook
2. `frontend/src/components/garden/UserProfileModal.tsx` - Uses read-only hook

## Testing

Open the User Profile Modal - you should see:

- ✅ Correct badge displayed immediately
- ✅ No console logs
- ✅ No subscription updates triggered
- ✅ Can open/close modal repeatedly with no side effects

---

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Impact:** Cleaner modal behavior, no unwanted updates
