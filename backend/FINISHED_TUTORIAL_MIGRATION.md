# Finished Tutorial Field Migration

## Summary
Successfully added a new `finished-tutorial` field to all existing users in ArangoDB.

## Details
- **Field Name**: `finished-tutorial`
- **Data Type**: Boolean
- **Default Value**: `false`
- **Users Updated**: 18 users

## Migration Script
The migration was performed using the script located at:
`backend/scripts/add_finished_tutorial_field.py`

## What Was Done
1. Connected to ArangoDB database (`social_db`)
2. Queried the `users` collection to find all users without the `finished-tutorial` field
3. Updated all users to add the field with a default value of `false`
4. Updated the `updated_at` timestamp for each modified user
5. Verified that all users now have the field

## Verification
All 18 users in the database now have the `finished-tutorial` field set to `false`:
- nonexistent_user
- alice
- bob
- david
- charlie
- frank
- eve
- lonely_user
- test_user
- test_user_123
- test_user_id
- user123
- test123
- friend_test_123
- And 4 additional users with hashed IDs

## Usage
The `finished-tutorial` field can now be used to track whether a user has completed the tutorial. To update a user's tutorial status, simply update this field to `true` in the user document.

## Files Created
1. `/backend/scripts/add_finished_tutorial_field.py` - Migration script
2. `/backend/verify_finished_tutorial.py` - Verification script

## Running the Migration Again
If you need to run this migration again (e.g., for new users without the field), simply execute:
```bash
cd backend
python scripts/add_finished_tutorial_field.py
```

The script is idempotent - it will only update users that don't already have the field.
